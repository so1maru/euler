euler - Fast solutions in C99
==============================
Project euler (https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.

Compiling
------------------------------
Any decent C compiler should work (the solutions were tested with gcc 15.1.1 on Arch Linux). For example, to compile <euler1.c> (the angled brackets are not part of the file name), type:

    gcc euler1.c -o euler1 -std=c99 -Wall -O2

to produce a binary named <euler1>. It should be in the same directory as the source code. Run the binary with 

    ./euler1

to ouput the solution.
